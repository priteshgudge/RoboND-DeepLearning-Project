### Deep Learning Follow Me Project

## Introduction
The project was aimed at implementing a Drone Simulation to follow a moving entity 
in an environment with multiple distractions. A fully convolutional neural network with 
multiple hidden layers was used to used to accomplish this.

## Data Collection
Data collection was performed by using the simulator. Specifically, two cases were covered.
First, the drone has two patrol points with the `hero` following a zigzag path underneath, 
with other spawns(crowd figures) present.
Second, the drone follows the target with a complicated path traced, also with crowd figures.
